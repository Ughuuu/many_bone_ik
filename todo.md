1. for limit cone directions: intersect camera mouse ray with the kusudama sphere and pick the closest intersection.
2. for limit cone radius, same as direction, except take the arccosine of the dot product with the direction to get the radius
3. for axial angle: intersect with xz plane, take arcosine of dot product with the z axis
